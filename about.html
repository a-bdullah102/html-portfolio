<h1>About me </h1>
<p>Hello! My name is Abdullah Haroon Khan, and I am a passionate web developer from Lahore, Pakistan. I am currently pursuing a Bachelor of Science in Computer Science at the University of Management and Technology (UMT).</p>

  <p>With a strong foundation in HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, I have honed my skills in creating responsive and visually appealing websites. I am also exploring the exciting world of React to further enhance my capabilities in modern web development.</p>
  
  <p>Currently, I am gaining valuable experience as a web developer intern in the MIS department at Shaukat Khanum Memorial Cancer Hospital. This opportunity has allowed me to apply my knowledge in a real-world setting, contributing to meaningful projects that support the hospital's mission.</p>
  
  <p>When I'm not coding, I enjoy spending my time learning new technologies and staying updated with the latest trends in web development. I am always eager to take on new challenges and continuously improve my skills.</p>
  
  <p>Thank you for visiting my website. Feel free to explore my projects and get in touch with me for any web development needs or collaborations.</p>
